# Alabaster Engine
 This is the most recent version of my very old C game engine. I think it was last worked on in early 2019.
 
This was years of game development self education, the only game release to come out of it was ![Space Shoot](https://izach.itch.io/space-shoot). A game I forced myself to make in a week. I'll probably upload the source code for space shoot eventually.
 
I'd love to come back to game development some day.
